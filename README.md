## DecisionTree

C++ library for decision tree classification algorithm. 

## Overview

Decision Trees (DTs) are a supervised learning method for classification and regression. There are many advantages for decision trees, e.g. simple to understand and to interpret, requires small data preparation. The `decisiontree` library provides a straightforward interfaces that make it very easy to use and integrate. 

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with C++14 support
- CMake >= 3.26.5
- GTest >= 1.14.0

## Installation

`decisiontree` can be installed manually via cmake. After clone or download (and unzip) the repository go to the root and type:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
make install
```
